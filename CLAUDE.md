# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Distr is an open-source software distribution platform that enables companies to distribute applications to self-managed customers.
It provides centralized management of deployments, artifacts, agents, licenses, and includes an OCI-compatible container registry.
The platform consists of a control plane (Hub) running in the cloud and agents that run in customer environments.

## Architecture

### High-Level Components

1. **Distr Hub** (`cmd/hub/`): The main control plane server
   - Go backend with chi router
   - Angular frontend (TypeScript, TailwindCSS 4)
   - REST API at `/api/v1`
   - Serves the compiled frontend on root path

2. **Agents** (`cmd/agent/`):
   - `docker/`: Docker agent for managing Docker Compose deployments
   - `kubernetes/`: Kubernetes agent for managing Helm deployments
   - Agents connect to Hub, collect logs/metrics, execute deployments

3. **SDK** (`sdk/js/`): JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for interacting with Distr API

### SDK Architecture (TypeScript)

The SDK is a standalone subproject in `sdk/js/` with its own package.json, dependencies, and build process.

- **Location**: `sdk/js/`
- **Package**: `@distr-sh/distr-sdk`
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Build**: `pnpm build` (compiles TypeScript to `dist/`)
- **Test**: `pnpm test:examples` (runs example test client)
- **Examples**: `sdk/js/src/examples/` contains usage examples
- **Main classes**:
  - `Client`: Low-level API client (in `src/client/client.ts`)
  - `DistrService`: High-level service with convenience methods (in `src/client/service.ts`)

When working with the SDK:

- Always build the SDK with `mise build:sdk` after making changes
- Use pnpm (not npm) for all package management
- Use `DistrService` for high-level operations (preferred)
- Use `Client` for direct API access when needed
- Example files use a config from `src/examples/config.ts`

### Backend Architecture (Go)

- **Database**: PostgreSQL accessed via pgx/v5 with connection pooling
- **Router**: chi/v5 with middleware-based architecture
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with support for OIDC, API keys, and agent tokens
- **OCI Registry**: Adapted from google/go-containerregistry for serving Docker images, Helm charts, and other artifacts
- **Storage**: S3-compatible object storage (rustfs for dev) for registry blobs and Loki log chunks
- **Log storage**: Deployment and deployment target log records are stored in Grafana Loki (not PostgreSQL), accessed through the `internal/logstore` package (`LogStore` interface, Loki implementation, in-memory fake for tests). The log record types (`logstore.DeploymentLogRecord`, `logstore.DeploymentTargetLogRecord`) live in this package, not in `internal/types`, since they are not database entities. The org ID is passed explicitly to every store method and maps to the Loki tenant (`X-Scope-OrgID`). Log retention is time-based and managed by the Loki config (shipped default: 30 days); read queries are limited to a subscription-dependent query window (`subscription.GetLogQueryWindow`: 24 hours for Community/Starter, 7 days otherwise). Log exports (deployment logs, deployment target logs and deployment status) honor the `before`/`after`/`filter` query parameters of the log viewer and are hard-capped at `subscription.MaxLogExportRows` (1,000,000 lines) for every subscription type; truncated exports end with a notice in the downloaded file
- **Migrations**: SQL migrations in `internal/migrations/sql/` managed by golang-migrate
- **Database queries**: All database interactions are in `internal/db/` with transaction support
- **Agent versions**: Every deployment target points at an `AgentVersion` row, which determines the image tag of the rendered agent manifest, and agents self-update as soon as the version they receive differs from the one they run. On startup the hub upserts its own version (`db.CreateAgentVersion`) and then assigns it to every target that has automatic updates enabled (`db.ApplyAutomaticAgentUpdates`), so upgrading the hub upgrades those agents with it. Enabling the option through the API applies the current version right away instead of waiting for the next restart

Key internal packages:

- `internal/handlers/`: HTTP request handlers
- `internal/routing/`: Route configuration and middleware setup
- `internal/authn/`: Authentication providers (JWT, API keys, agent tokens)
- `internal/db/`: Database queries and models
- `internal/logstore/`: Log record storage (Loki-backed, with in-memory fake for tests)
- `internal/registry/`: OCI registry implementation
- `internal/middleware/`: HTTP middleware (logging, auth, Sentry, etc.)
- `internal/svc/`: Business logic services
- `internal/mapping/`: Mapping logic for data transformations between DTOs and domain models
- `internal/advisory/`: Storage-independent security advisory rules, most importantly the customer visibility predicate
- `api/`: All request structs used by HTTP handlers should be in the api package and not in the handler package

### Frontend Architecture (Angular)

- **Framework**: Angular with standalone components
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS 4, SCSS, Flowbite components
- **Routing**: Angular Router with lazy-loaded routes
- **State**: Service-based state management
- **Forms**: Reactive forms with Angular Forms
- **Key directories**:
  - `frontend/ui/src/app/`: All application components
  - `frontend/ui/src/app/services/`: Data services and API clients
  - `frontend/ui/src/app/components/`: Reusable UI components
  - `frontend/ui/src/buildconfig/`: Build-time configuration injected by Go

The frontend is built into `internal/frontend/dist/ui/` and served by the Go backend.

### Database Schema

The database schema is managed through SQL migrations in `internal/migrations/sql/`. Key tables include:

- `user_accounts`: User authentication and profiles
- `organizations`: Multi-tenant organizations
- `deployments`: Application deployments
- `deployment_targets`: Customer environments (agents)
- `deploymentmetrics` & `deploymentresourcemetrics`: Per-deployment resource usage reports (one parent row per agent push, one child row per container with CPU millicores and memory bytes, plus nullable limits)
- `artifacts`: Software artifacts (Docker images, Helm charts)
- `applications`: Artifact collections
- `licensekey`: License keys that vendors can generate for its customers
- `application_entitlements` & `artifact_entitlements`: Access entitlements for applications and artifacts
- `advisory`: Security advisories a vendor tracks and discloses, with link tables for tags, references, affected/fixed versions, and an append-only event timeline

This database stores timestamps as `TIMESTAMP` (without time zone), not `TIMESTAMPTZ`.

## Common Commands

### Building

```sh
# Build hub (includes frontend build)
mise run build:hub:community        # Community edition

# Build agents
mise run build:agent:docker
mise run build:agent:kubernetes

# Build the website (website/)
mise run build:website
```

Binaries are output to `dist/`.

### Formatting

```sh
mise run format              # All, including the website
mise run format:app          # Hub and agents, without the website
mise run format:go           # Go only
mise run format:frontend     # Frontend only
mise run format:website      # Website only, also prunes unused images
```

Go formatting is configured in `.golangci.yml`, the frontend uses Prettier with config in `.prettierrc.mjs`.
The website is a separate pnpm project with its own Prettier config; the root config ignores `website/`.

## Code Patterns and Conventions

### Go Code

- Use `context.Context` for request-scoped values and cancellation
- Database queries return `pgx.Rows` or use `pgx.QueryRow` for single rows
- Always use `defer rows.Close()` after querying
- Use `internal/db/queryable.Queryable` interface for queries (supports both `*pgxpool.Pool` and `pgx.Tx`)
- HTTP handlers receive dependencies via closure (database pool, logger, etc.)
- Error handling uses `internal/apierrors` for API errors with proper status codes
- Use `internal/context` helpers to retrieve logger, database, user from context
- Do not add new context accessors to `internal/context`. Following idiomatic Go, they belong in the package that defines the stored type (e.g. `logstore.NewContext`/`logstore.FromContext`), which also avoids import cycles
- Use structured logging with zap: `logger.Info("message", zap.String("key", value))`
- Send exceptions to sentry with: `sentry.GetHubFromContext(ctx).CaptureException(err)`. In a background job use `sentry.CurrentHub()` instead: a job context carries no hub, and taking one from it panics
- When performing data transformations between DTOs and domain models, use `mapping.List(...)` inside the `internal/mapping` package
- Give types in `internal/types` `db:` tags only. Never serialize one into a response and never embed one in an `api` type. Do not copy the existing embeddings (`api.OrganizationResponse`, `api.LicenseKeyRevision`); they are legacy
- Give every endpoint its own struct in `api/` and put both conversion directions in `internal/mapping`: `XToAPI` for model to response, `XToInternal` for request to model. Do not assemble an `api.*` or `types.*` struct field by field in a handler
- Reference shared string enums (`types.UserRole`, `types.DomainType`, `types.OIDCProvider`) from `api` directly instead of duplicating them
- Always use [Gomega](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/) for test assertions in Go tests
- Do not use `util.PtrTo`. Use `new(value)` to obtain a `*T` from a typed value (e.g. `new(types.UserRoleReadOnly)`).
- Use `errors.AsType[E](err)` instead of `errors.As(err, &target)` wherever the target type is known at the call site, since it needs no pre-declared variable: `if pgErr, ok := errors.AsType[*pgconn.PgError](err); ok && pgErr.Code == pgerrcode.UniqueViolation`. `errors.As` remains correct where the target is an interface a caller passes in.
- The body of a 4xx response is displayed verbatim in the frontend forms (`getFormDisplayedError`), so write those messages for the end user and put anything only a developer can use into the log instead.

### Frontend Code

- Always use self-closing tags for Angular components when they have no content (e.g. `<fa-icon [icon]="faPlus" />` instead of `<fa-icon [icon]="faPlus"></fa-icon>`)
- Use standalone components (no NgModules) - This is the default so `standalone: true` is not needed
- `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` is the default, so never write `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`. Only set `changeDetection` to opt a component out with `ChangeDetectionStrategy.Eager`, and remove that opt-out whenever the component's state is fully signal-based
- Services should be singleton by default with `providedIn: 'root'`
- Use Angular's `inject()` function for dependency injection (e.g. `private readonly http = inject(HttpClient)`). Do not use constructor injection.
- Component file structure: `component-name.component.ts`, `component-name.component.html`, and a `component-name.component.scss` only when the component needs styling of its own beyond utility classes in the template
- Use TypeScript interfaces from `app/types/` for API models
- Use reactive forms for all form handling
- Use as little `undefined` types as possible, always use the actual type
- Don't use any svg path icons, always look for a matching icon in the icon library used. These icons should always be the same in the import, the component and template e.g. `faServer` and not `serverIcon`.
  This applies to CSS too: never hand-write an inline SVG or an `url("data:image/svg+xml,...")` background, not even to restyle a browser or Flowbite default.
- Before inventing a new pattern for a shared control, look at how the same control is already used elsewhere and reuse that. The indeterminate "select all" checkbox, for example, needs nothing beyond `distr-checkbox`; the sizing and centering of the dash is already handled there.
- Use [Angular Signals](https://angular.dev/guide/signals) for inputs, child views and everywhere where the current Angular version supports signals.
  If you find usages of non signal usages for inputs, child views etc. change them to signals in the files you would edit anyway.
- Don't use any responsive design classes in modals. They should always be optimized for the none mobile use case.
- Never bind a template to a method call (`@if (getUsage(x))`, `{{ formatFoo(y) }}`). A template expression is re-evaluated on every change detection pass, once per instance of the view it sits in, so on a page with many rows the work is multiplied by the row count. Express it as a `computed` instead. The same applies to anything a template reads indirectly: a getter or service method called from a template has to be cheap and must not decode, parse or re-derive anything (see the claims cache in `AuthService`).
- Never let a pipe perform I/O itself. Angular creates one pipe instance per binding, so an `HttpClient` call inside `transform` becomes one request per element and the same resource is fetched again for every place it appears. Put the request in a `providedIn: 'root'` service that caches by key and shares the in-flight observable (`shareReplay`), and reduce the pipe to a delegate (see `SecureImageCache` and `SecureImagePipe` in `frontend/ui/src/util/secureImage.ts`). Relying on the browser's HTTP cache is not enough: every instance still runs the interceptor chain and allocates its own copy of the response.
- Use Angular's `takeUntilDestroyed` instead of a manual `destroyed$` subject.
- Use [Angular Signal Based Animations](https://angular.dev/guide/animations) instead of legacy animations defined in the component.
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for text transformations (e.g. `capitalize`, `uppercase`, `lowercase`) instead of TypeScript string manipulation when possible.
- Use [NgPlural](https://angular.dev/api/common/NgPlural) with `ngPluralCase` for pluralized text in templates instead of ternaries like `count === 1 ? 'day' : 'days'`:

  ```html
  <ng-container [ngPlural]="count()">
    <ng-template ngPluralCase="=1">day</ng-template>
    <ng-template ngPluralCase="other">days</ng-template>
  </ng-container>
  ```

- Reuse the shared global `distr-*` component classes defined in `frontend/ui/src/styles/theme.scss` (e.g. `distr-input`, `distr-checkbox`, `distr-radio`, `distr-label`) instead of repeating their Tailwind utility chains inline, and add a new one there when an element's styling is repeated across the app. Append only element-specific extra utilities when needed (e.g. a `distr-checkbox` with `indeterminate:bg-[length:65%_65%]`). Express a state that Tailwind has a variant for through that variant in the shared class (`disabled:`, `read-only:`) rather than through a utility at the call site, so every instance behaves the same. A variant class such as `distr-input-raised` has to be defined below the class it overrides, since both live in `@layer components` where source order decides. Keep in mind that Tailwind scans this file too, so any class name written here is emitted into the stylesheet: prefer describing a class to pasting a full `class="..."` attribute.
- Styling that a component always needs, no matter where it is used, belongs on the component itself via `host: {class: '…'}` (e.g. `app-search-bar`, `app-editor`), not repeated on every tag in the templates of its callers. Leave only what varies per call site in the template.
- Styling used by a single component belongs to that component's `component-name.component.scss`, not to `theme.scss`. Tailwind compiles every component stylesheet on its own, so `@apply` there needs `@reference '<path>/styles/tailwind.css'` (the Tailwind entry point, which holds the `@theme` tokens and the `dark` variant) as the first line of the file. Without it the build fails with `Cannot apply unknown utility class`. Keep that entry point plain CSS, since `@reference` cannot read Sass. Prefer the `.scss` file over an inline `styles` block: Tailwind scans `.ts` files for class names, so utilities that appear only inside an inline `@apply` are also emitted into the global stylesheet, where nothing uses them.
- Never build a map of Tailwind utility chains in the component class to pick a variant at runtime; put the variants into the stylesheet.
- Every badge uses one of the shared badge classes: `distr-status-badge` for anything that shows a state, with the colors of that state (including a `border-*`) supplied by a color helper next to the feature, `distr-tag-badge` for a free-form label such as a tag, and `distr-deployment-type-badge` or `distr-artifact-tag` for those two specific labels. They all share the bordered, slightly rounded shape, so do not write a new pill inline.
- When a state a badge shows can also be set, use `app-badge-select` rather than a row of buttons or a separate `<select>`, so that the value and the control changing it are the same element. It emits the picked value instead of writing it, so the caller sends the request and passes back what the server returned.

### Database Access

All database access should go through `internal/db/` functions. Never write raw SQL in handlers or services. If you need a new query, add it to the appropriate file in `internal/db/`.

Always use `now()` for the current time, never `current_timestamp`. This applies to queries in `internal/db/` as well as to SQL migrations in `internal/migrations/sql/`, including column defaults.

Transaction pattern:

```go
err := db.BeginFunc(ctx, func(tx pgx.Tx) error {
    // Do queries with tx
    return nil
})
```

#### Enum Types

Model a closed set of values as a Postgres enum type, not as a `TEXT` column with a `CHECK (col IN (...))` constraint. `CHECK` constraints are for cross-column invariants (e.g. `(type = 'docker') = (scope IS NULL)`).

When you add a Postgres enum type, register it (and its array type, prefixed with `_`) in the `AfterConnect` type list in `internal/svc/db_pool.go`, e.g. `CUSTOM_DOMAIN_TYPE` and `_CUSTOM_DOMAIN_TYPE`. Without it pgx cannot encode Go values into the enum's OID. Cast query parameters to the enum type, never to `TEXT`: `unnest(@domainTypes::CUSTOM_DOMAIN_TYPE[])`, since Postgres does not implicitly coerce `text` to an enum. Pass the Go string type itself (`[]types.DomainType`), not `[]string`.

#### Read-only Database

An optional read-only database (e.g. a replica) can be configured via `DATABASE_READONLY_URL` (and `DATABASE_READONLY_MAX_CONNS`). When unset, no read-only pool is created and everything uses the primary. When set, it is injected into the request context by `ContextInjectorMiddleware` via `WithReadonlyDB` (the primary is always injected via `WithDb`).

To serve an endpoint from the read-only db, apply the `middleware.UseReadonlyDB` middleware to its route. It swaps the context's active db to the read-only pool so all `db.*` calls in the handler use it, and is a **noop** when no read-only db is configured. Rules:

- Only use it for routes that perform **exclusively read-only** queries.
- Never use it for routes that are part of an update-and-refetch loop in the frontend (the read-only db may lag behind the primary). Good candidates are logs, analytics, dashboards, metrics, and status timeseries.
- Place it **after** authentication/authorization middleware so those lookups keep hitting the primary. Applying it at the router mount (`r.With(middleware.UseReadonlyDB).Route(...)`) is fine when the whole router is read-only; otherwise wrap only the relevant read routes in a group.
- Do not use it for read-after-write workloads. In particular, the OCI registry always uses the primary: container clients rely on immediate consistency (push then pull/HEAD, multi-arch index push, signing), which a lagging replica would break.

### Batch Inserts

Use `pgx.CopyFrom` with `pgx.CopyFromSlice` for inserting multiple rows. Never use individual `INSERT` statements in a loop.

```go
_, err := db.CopyFrom(
    ctx,
    pgx.Identifier{"tablename"},
    []string{"col1", "col2"},
    pgx.CopyFromSlice(len(items), func(i int) ([]any, error) {
        return []any{items[i].Col1, items[i].Col2}, nil
    }),
)
```

### Scheduled Jobs

A job has to be runnable from outside the hub process, because a high-availability installation would otherwise run it once per replica. Register it in `internal/svc/jobs_scheduler.go` behind its own `*_CRON` env var that defaults to unscheduled, give it a subcommand (`cleanup` for pruning, `maintenance` for everything else), and add a `cronJobs` entry to `deploy/charts/distr/values.yaml` that calls it. Never make behaviour outside the job itself depend on whether its cron is scheduled: in the chart it never is, since the CronJob runs it.

### Subscription Gating

Never gate a feature by listing the subscription types that are allowed to use it. Every such allowlist has to be touched again whenever a new plan is introduced, and the plan silently loses the feature if it is forgotten. Always express gating as a denylist of the lower plans instead, so a new plan gets access by default:

- Go: use `types.NonProSubscriptionTypes` with `SubscriptionType.IsPro()`, `middleware.ForbidSubscriptionTypes(...)` or the ready-made `middleware.ProFeature`.
- Frontend: use `isProSubscription()` / `isPayingSubscription()` from `app/types/subscription.ts`, or `NON_PRO_SUBSCRIPTION_TYPES` / `NON_PAYING_SUBSCRIPTION_TYPES` when a list is needed.

The only exceptions are plan-specific billing UI (checkout, plan comparison) and upsell banners for one particular plan, which are inherently tied to concrete plans.

Organization features (`types.Feature`) come from two sources and must not be mixed up. Plan-managed features are granted by `types.FeaturesForSubscriptionType` and collected in `types.PlanManagedFeatures`; they are the only ones that may be revoked when an organization loses its plan. Everything else is granted out of band — `vendor_billing` by staff, `pre_post_scripts` and `artifact_version_mutable` by an organization admin in the settings — and must survive plan changes and edition reconciliation. Never overwrite the whole `features` array to revoke a plan; remove `types.PlanManagedFeatures` from it.

### Sending Mail

Never take the mailer straight from the context. An organization can configure its own SMTP server (`CustomEmailConfiguration`), which overrides the instance mailer built from the `MAILER_*` env vars, so every sender resolves its transport with `custommail.MailerForOrganization(ctx, orgID)` and its sender address with `custommail.FromAddressOrDefault(ctx, orgID, branding)`. Both fall back to the instance defaults when the organization has no enabled configuration, and neither falls back when sending through a configured server fails — the instance mailer would send from a domain that server's sender address does not belong to, which fails SPF/DKIM/DMARC and hides the misconfiguration.

The organization must be passed explicitly rather than read from the authentication: background jobs have no authentication in their context (`internal/jobs/runner.go`), and notification mail is sent from exactly there.

### API Routes

API routes are defined in `internal/routing/`. Routes are grouped by authentication requirements:

- Public routes (no auth)
- User routes (JWT auth required)
- Admin routes (admin user required)
- Agent routes (agent token auth)
- Registry routes (special OCI auth)

When adding new routes, ensure the OpenAPI spec remains valid. The `chiopenapi` router generates the spec from route definitions. Endpoints that have path parameters, query parameters, or a request body must declare them via `option.Request()` with a struct using the appropriate tags (`path:`, `query:`, `json:`). Endpoints without any parameters or body do not need `option.Request()`. Follow the existing pattern of composing path param structs with body request structs via embedding.

### Generated URLs

Never hard-wire `https://` into a URL that is built for this instance. The scheme is `env.HostScheme()`, taken from `DISTR_HOST` (https unless it explicitly says http). It returns the `env.URLScheme` enum (`env.SchemeHTTP` / `env.SchemeHTTPS`), which is also what a parsed URL's scheme is compared against, rather than a bare `"https"` string:

- For a URL on the host of the current request use `handlerutil.GetRequestSchemeAndHost(r)`. It keeps the request's host, so a request on a custom domain stays on it, and takes the scheme from the configuration rather than the request, which arrives as plain http behind a TLS-terminating proxy.
- For a URL on another host — an organization's custom domain in `customdomains.withScheme`, the login forwarding target, the OIDC callback URL an administrator has to register (`oidc.CustomCallbackURL`) — use `env.HostScheme()` directly.

A hard-wired https breaks every locally running instance, and for the OIDC callback URL it produces a URL that disagrees with the `redirect_uri` the login actually sends. In the frontend, use the protocol of the current page for the same reason.

Build the host of such a URL through the `internal/customdomains` resolvers and never from `db.GetCustomDomains` directly: only the resolvers drop the domains that have not been verified yet. Do not add that filter anywhere else. Listing a caller's domains and resolving the host of an incoming request deliberately accept unverified domains.

## Comments

Write as few comments as possible. A comment has to earn its place by saying something the code cannot, and every comment that does not is noise that goes stale and has to be reviewed forever.

Do not write a comment that:

- Restates the code or the name below it, including doc comments on self-explanatory types, fields, functions and env getters. A getter named after the value it returns needs no comment saying that it returns that value.
- Explains the change you are making, why it is correct, or what was there before. That belongs in the commit message or the pull request description, not in the code.
- Narrates a step of an obvious sequence (`// send the request`, `// parse the response`).
- Explains a styling or layout choice in a template, or a language detail a reader of that language already knows.
- Repeats what the documentation, a rule in this file, or a linked ticket already says.

Do write a comment when it records something a reader cannot see:

- A constraint imposed from outside the code, e.g. a requirement of a third-party API, a browser or protocol quirk, or a database limitation the code has to work around.
- Why a non-obvious approach was chosen over the obvious one, when the obvious one is wrong or breaks something.
- A deliberate invariant that a future change would silently break.

## Tests

Only write a test that could fail for a real reason. Every test is code that has to be maintained, and a test that restates the implementation costs maintenance without ever catching a bug.

- Do not test guard clauses, getters, plain mappings, a single `if` branch, or that a value passed in comes back out.
- Do not write a test whose assertion is trivially true because the dependency it needs is not configured in tests.
- Do test behavior that is hard to get right and expensive to get wrong: wire formats sent to third parties, fail-closed security behavior, parsing, permission and subscription gating, and non-trivial query or business logic.
- Prefer a few focused tests over an exhaustive matrix of near-duplicates.

## General rules

- Always ensure this file is up-to-date.
- This file holds instructions and conventions for the agent, not technical documentation. Add a rule that changes what an agent does; never a description of how a feature, endpoint or subsystem works. That belongs in the code, in a doc comment, or on the website.
- Always build, test and format through mise tasks (`mise run build:hub:community`, `mise run test:go`, `mise run test:frontend`, `mise run format`). Never invoke `go build`, `go test`, `golangci-lint` or `pnpm` directly.
- When you add, remove, or change an environment variable in `internal/env/env.go` (name, default, required/optional status, or accepted values), update the configuration reference page at `website/src/content/docs/docs/self-hosting/configuration.mdx` in the same change so it stays complete and accurate.
- If a user requests you to do something differently, add the difference to a new rule / convention in this file
- If you read code that doesn't follow these rules, please fix it.
- If you see any typos, or spelling mistakes, please fix them.
- If you fetch data from GitHub always use the GitHub cli (`gh`) instead of the web interface.
- Scripting language preference, for anything from a one-off command to a checked-in script: shell first (like `hack/validate-migrations.sh`), Node when a task outgrows shell (like `hack/agent-changelog.mjs`). Avoid Python, and never use Perl (e.g. `perl -pi -e`). Edit existing files directly instead of piping them through a stream editor.
- When you resolve merge conflicts (whether during a merge or rebase), always ensure that the conflict resolutions are committed before continuing, or at least prompt the user to commit them, so that unrelated new changes are not unintentionally included in that commit.
