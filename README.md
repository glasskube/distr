### Docker

The Distr Hub is distributed as a Docker image via ghcr.io.
Check out [`deploy/docker`](deploy/docker) for our example deployment using Docker Compose.
To get started quickly, do the following:

```shell
mkdir distr && cd distr && curl -fsSL https://github.com/glasskube/distr/releases/latest/download/deploy-docker.tar.bz2 | tar -jx
# make necessary changes to the .env file
docker-compose up -d
```

### Kubernetes

Distr is also available as a Helm chart distributed via ghcr.io.
Check out [`deploy/charts/distr`](deploy/charts/distr) for our Helm Chart source code.
To install Distr in Kubernetes, simply run:

```shell
helm upgrade --install --wait --namespace distr --create-namespace \
  distr oci://ghcr.io/glasskube/charts/distr \
  --set postgresql.enabled=true --set minio.enabled=true
```

For a quick testing setup, you don't have to modify the values.
However, if you intend to use distr in production, please revisit all available configuration values and adapt them accordingly.
You can find them in the reference [values.yaml](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/distr/distr?modal=values) file.

The full self-hosting documentation is at https://distr.sh/docs/self-hosting/self-hosting/

Using Distr agents on macOS? Follow the [guide](https://distr.sh/docs/guides/distr-on-macos/) to get started.

### Building from source

To build Distr Hub from source, first ensure that the following build dependencies are installed:

- NodeJS (Version 22)
- Go (Version 1.24)
- Docker (when building the Docker images)

We recommend that you use [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to install these tools, but you do don't have to.

All build tasks can be found in the [`Makefile`](Makefile), for example:

```shell
# Build the control plane
make build
# Build all docker images
make build-docker
```

### Local development

To run the Distr Hub locally, you need to clone the repository and run the following commands:

```shell
# Start the database and a mock SMTP server
docker-compose up -d
# Start Distr Hub
make run
```

Open your browser and navigate to [`http://localhost:8080/register`](http://localhost:8080/register) to register a user
and receive the E-Mail verification link via Mailpit on [`http://localhost:8025`](http://localhost:8025).

## Distr SDK

Interact with Distr directly from your application code using our first-party SDK.
The Distr SDK is currently available for JavaScript only, but more languages and frameworks are on the roadmap.
Let us know what you would like to see!

You can install the Distr SDK for JavaScript from [npmjs.org](https://npmjs.org/):

```shell
npm install --save @glasskube/distr-sdk
```

The full SDK documentation is at https://distr.sh/docs/integrations/sdk/
